    <p> You are more than just your looks. You are a human being who has qualities and personality, which is important. They make up who you are overall. To depend on your qualities, you have to know them.
      You can figure out what your qualities are by spending time with yourself. Get to know who you are. Ask yourself. Who am I? What do I like? How do I treat people? How do I react in certain situations?
      Knowing these things, can help boost your confidence up. So everytime you may feel small, you uplifting yourself with your qualities will help you feel better.
