    <p>Complients from other can be a confidence booster at times, so there is nothing wrong with 
      accepting them. However, solely depending on them can cause a self-esteem rollercoaster. That;s why having internal validation is 
      better than external. Depending on internal validation is when you uplift yourself without others. Remember, this is your life!
      Only you have the power to validate yourself. Will you have rejections or not from others? Yes!! But, those don't define you.
      You will always be you. Don't give others the power to validate you, when they don't validate themselves.
