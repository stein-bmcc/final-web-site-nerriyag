    <p> Listen, just because you see a person 'having it all together', does not meant that you don't or you won't. Half of these people you see, 
      don't even have it all together. Why? Because there is no such thing. 9 times out of ten, what you see isn't real. And if it is, you don't know what 
      people had to go through to get there. You are enough and you are just as great. Idenify your behaviors when you self compare,
      and try to figure out why you are having those behaviors. So if you compare yourself and you feel insecure. Uplift yourself by saying something
      postitive about you. Recoginze your strengths, the things you can do, and the things you survived. And tell yourself, that you can do anything that you put your mind to and that you
      can bounce back from anything.
